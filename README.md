# Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) â€” Study Repo

This repo contains my personal journey through the book **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)** by Remzi & Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau.

It includes:

- Chapter summaries
- Code examples & solutions
- Projects (linked here if large enough for separate repos)

## Goals

- Understand OS fundamentals: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence
- Practice low-level C and systems programming
